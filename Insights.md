# Top Level Insights 

I found very interesting insights, health is a topic that is becoming more and more important, there are new recent studies that support data on how to maximize our health, productivity, focus and overall wellbeing. 

So I will be focusing here on how to improve our health and habits based on the data captured by a smart device that tracks sleep, activity, steps and calories.


### Average Daily Activity
First we have the average activity minutes per day from this group. According to OMS the recommended daily activity should be at least 30 mins, here the group is exercising just 13.56 mins per day so it is very important to increase this number, we will see positive effects on health, energy, mental health and overall performance during the day. 

### Caloric Expenditure
Calories measure the energy that we consume or spend, in this case we see the avg spend of calories of the group. I want to point out that the more sedentary the person is the more calories he/she spends leading to more chances of getting overweight and several more deseases. On the contrary we can see a positive correlation when the person is more active, so the calorie expenditure is higher causing and improvement on healh, metabolism, energy and so on.

### Daily Total Sleep
Now I want to focus on sleep which is very important for us since it helps the immune system, recovery and more health benefits. The amount of sleep varies from one another but the recommendation is always between 7 - 8 hours (420 to 480 mins). We see that the correlation is positive if a person stays more in bed and his/her total minutes of sleep which is obvious, but this can give us ideas on for example set an alarm that tells us to go to sleep at an specific time.

### Weight and BMI
Last we have the weight and BMI (Body mass index) of the users, BMI is a value derived from the mass and height of the person, basically we want to see that our weight is healthy, BMI can go below 18.5 which is under weight, 18.5 to 24.9 that is a healthy weight, 25 to 29.9 that is overweight and over 30 which is obesity. We see that the average of the group is 21.57 which is a healthy weight and just one person that has a BMI of 47.54 which is obesity. We can see also that doing more steps daily can lower your BMI and weight. 

## Conclusions 

- General health of the group is good, in some datasets we have 33 users and in others we have 14 and even just 8 users which limits the analysis that we can do
- The group is generally lighlty active, we see that the avg active minutes per day is only 13.56 and sedentary minutes are 991 so we need to lower the sedentary minutes and make and effort on improving the active minutes daily
- Sleep is very important and we see that the group is doing good here so we need to maintain these levels
- BMI and weight tells so much about the health of a person, so is very important to maintain a certain level of weight depending on our height and body mass.

## Recommendations 

- Focus marketing campaigns on overall health, improving little things as doing more steps or exercising a little bit more during the day can have a great impact on our health
